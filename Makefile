# define the C compiler to use
CC = gcc

CFLAGS = -Wall -g

# define any directories containing header files other than /usr/include
#
INCLUDES = -Isrc/include

# define library paths in addition to /usr/lib
#   if I wanted to include libraries not in /usr/lib I'd specify
#   their path using -Lpath, something like:
LFLAGS = -Lsrc/lib

# define any libraries to link into executable:
#   if I want to link in libraries (libx.so or libx.a) I use the -llibname
#   option, something like (this will link in libmylib.so and libm.so:
LIBS = -lm

#
# This uses Suffix Replacement within a macro:
#   $(name:string1=string2)
#         For each word in 'name' replace 'string1' with 'string2'
# Below we are replacing the suffix .c of all words in the macro SRCS
# with the .o suffix

# The following part of the makefile is generic; it can be used to
